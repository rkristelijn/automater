# TODO

- [ ] fix errors in generated code, e.g. the mock data - can't we create a simple rest client with the v1 version of json-server or something or in nestjs backend
- [ ] check all best practices, e.g. no customizations in component usage, only in theme
- [ ] can we drop in another theme for the demo?
- [ ] is the documentation in line and complete so noob devs can become haxors from this repo?
